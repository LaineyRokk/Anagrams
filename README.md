Anagrams and Antigrams:
Code Review for Epicodus Ruby 9.8.2017

By Lainey Rokkan

Description
This Business Logic code project uses an algorithm to take a minimum of 2 inputs, comparing the second input to the first to determine if it is an anagram or not. The algorithm is also able to: determine if a confirmed anagram is also a palindrome; if the input is not an anagram whether or not it is an antigram; and should be able to evaluate more than a single input.
